# Choose Your Safari Adventure

A Choose Your Safari Adventure generator using Twine and Wikipedia data

Made for [NaNoGenMo 2018](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2018), more informations about the project [here](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2018/issues/72).

## Wikipedia Crawler

The `crawler/crawler.php` script crawls Wikipedia pages of animal species and builds a JSON file of the data.
I made some manual corrections to the `data.json` file, I removed empty data and added some areas information by hand.

## Twine Story Generator

Coming soon
